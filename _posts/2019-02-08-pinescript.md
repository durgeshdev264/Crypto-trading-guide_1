This page will be for tradingview tips n tweaks, but mostly about learning pinescript.

Tradingview.com created a coding language called Pine Script, allowing its users to create customized studies and signals they can run oun our servers. Please note that Pine was designed as a lightweight language, focused on the specific task of developing indicators. 

Pinescript was made to be easy accessible and easy to understand. Pine is cloud-based and only useful on tradingview, and not an actual programming language.
